    "# Ans. Abstraction :- is defined as a process of hiding the implementation details of a system from the user. Thus, \n",
    "#      by using abstraction, we provided only the functionality of the system to the user. Consequently, the user will have\n",
    "#      information on what the system does, but not on how the system does it.\n",

    "\n",
    "#     In encapsulation, the variables of a class are hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only by methods of the \n",
    "#     current class. Therefore, encapsulation is also called data hiding. Encapsulation is implemented using access modifiers\n",
